      <p> DARE-HTHP (Molecular Dynamics) is a Gateway for executing High-Performance Parallel codes such as NAMD and 
      AMBER in high-throughput mode across multiple distributed resources concurrently. 
      DARE-HTHP builds upon the  Dynamic Application Runtime-Environment (DARE) Framework, and is one of several Science Gateways for Life Science Applications.
</p>
<p>
Currently, user can run hundreds of un-coupled ensembles, with each ensemble-member running on hundreds of cores. The DARE framework
has been used to run hundreds of similar sized replica-exchange
simulations, and will be made available within this Gateway soon.
</p><p>
DARE-HTHP uses LONI and TeraGrid resources for production and FutureGrid-Clouds for testing. 
DARE-HTHP will be made available for a broad range of private and commercial Cloud Services in Spring 2011.
